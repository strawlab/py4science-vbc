Welcome to Py4Science at the Vienna Biocenter
=============================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly growing in popularity.
It is easy to read, easy to write and it features a great selection of powerful libraries.

Py4Science VBC (Vienna Bio Center) is a monthly meeting series
facilitating cross-pollination between interested parties who use
Python as part of their scientific tool set. Those wishing to attend
do not need to be expert at python programming, but familiarity with
the language and some popular libraries such as numpy and matplotlib
is encouraged. Even if you are a complete beginner the talks will be
short (15 minutes) followed by interactive discussions and
demonstrations so you will not be bored.

**Yapsy - a lightweight plugin framework for Python.**

  Rudolf Hoefler, IMBA

  Friday, 9 August 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  For software projects it is often convenient to implement certain
  functionality as plugins (e.g. ImageJ) to avoid re-installation of
  the whole package. Yapsy (Yet Another Plugin System) provides such a
  framework for Python. Developers focused on simplicity i.e. no
  dependencies except the standard library. It provides various
  classes for plugin management that can be easily extended.

**Pandas for practical, real world data analysis in Python**

  Andreas Poehlmann

  Friday, 7 June 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive
  data structures designed to make working with “relational” or
  “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental
  high-level building block for doing practical, real world data
  analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming
  the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis /
  manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its
  way toward this goal.

  pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
  - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or
  Excel spreadsheet
  - Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series
  data.
  - Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row
  and column labels
  - Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data
  actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data
  structure

  I'll give you an overview over the available data structures, the
  different file backends and some of the wonderful magical powers that
  pandas posseses. See you then!

**Complex Experiment Configuration, Control, Automation, and Analysis using Robot Operating System (ROS)**

  John Stowers

  Friday, 3 May 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  The Robot Operating System (ROS), and its Python bindings, are well known
  and used in the engineering and robotics communities for the many high
  level tools and algorithms they provide. Less appreciated are the lower
  levels of the ROS stack; libraries for inter-process-communication,
  parameter and configuration management, and distributed process launching
  and control.

  In the Straw laboratory we use ROS to automate the operation of, and
  experiments using, virtual reality systems for fixed and freely flying
  Drosophila. This includes real-time 10-camera tracking (100Hz), 5 projector
  panoramic virtual reality (120Hz), and real-time visual stimulus generation
  and control (80Hz). Operation of this system requires the launching of over
  30 processes on 4 computers, and the associated configuration of each in a
  known state. In addition, the progress of the experiment must be monitored
  over its entire 12 hour duration.

  In this talk we will describe how ROS makes this complex system manageable
  and reproducible by implicitly recording the state of the system at all
  times, and by automating the pre-configuration and launching of the
  multiple processes which control the experiment. I will also describe how
  we tag all experimental data with unique identifiers to facilitate live
  monitoring, post-experiment analysis, and long time archival in case later
  forensics are required.

  This talk will show that ROS is a very powerful tool and should not only be
  considered for engineering and robotics applications; but by any scientist
  for robustly and reproducibly managing complex scientific experiments.

  (This will be an abbreviated practice version of the same talk to be
  presented at SciPy2013 conference in June)

**CellCognition: A tool for time-resolved phenotype annotation in high-throughput live cell imaging**

  Christoph Sommer, IMBA

  Friday, 5 April 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  Automated microscopy has become an enabling technology to monitor
  and quantify properties of cells. A typical workflow to analyze
  microscopy data comprises the segmentation of cells, linking of cell
  objects over time, and quantification of cellular
  phenotypes. CellCognition is published as open source software,
  enabling automated analysis of live-cell image-based screening data.

**C# for Computer Graphics and hence for Scientific Computing**

  Robert Tobler, VRVis Research Center

  Friday, 1 March 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  Although C# does not have such a dedicated community for scientific
  computing as Python, its modern language features allow for a high
  level of code reuse and extend some of the features found in
  Python. I will show some examples from Computer Graphics, which show
  how the combination of generic and functional programming with a
  strong type system can benefit the impementation of algorithms for
  scientific computing.

  Since 2000, Dr. Tobler is a senior research at VRVis Research Center
  for Virtual Reality and Visualization in Vienna, Austria. His
  professional interests include real-time and photorealistic
  rendering, efficient global illumination algorithms, and
  procedurally generated geometry and generalized subdivision. His web
  page is http://rftobler.at/Personal/.

**A Bayesian t test using PyMC**

  Andrew Straw, IMP

  Friday, 1 February 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  Across many branches of biology, null hypothesis significance
  testing is the tried-and-true method of establishing whether an
  effect is "real". Nevertheless, many pitfalls must be avoided to
  correctly evaluate statistical significance and it is easy to make
  mistakes that render the analysis invalid. I will summarize a recent
  paper *Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test* ("BEST") by John
  Kruschke (2012, Journal of Experimental Psychology:
  General.). Kruschke's Bayesian approach purports to acheive the same
  goals as the t test with fewer potential pitfalls. Furthermore, his
  approach has several advantages, such as the ability to accept the
  null hypothesis. Computationally, credible intervals of important
  parameters such population means and effect size are found using
  Monte-Carlo techniques such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. I
  will discuss a `Python implementation of the BEST algorithm
  <http://github.com/strawlab/best>`_ written using PyMC.

**Python-powered voice analysis**

  Christian Herbst, University of Vienna

  Friday, 7 December 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

**profiling: why is my script running so slow?**

  Uemit Seren, Gregor Mendel Institute

  Friday, 28 September 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  Profiling is an important but often neglected aspect in programming,
  especially in the area of scientific computing. I will show various
  tools that can be used to identify performance hotspots in your
  code.  We will use timeit to measure the execution time, move on to
  cProfile and pstats for detailed profiling. Based on the results of
  cProfile I will show how to interpret the results visually and
  finally demonstrate line_profiler.py for retrieving line by line
  profiling information.


**Scientific GUIs on Linux using Gtk**

  John Stowers, IMP

  Friday, 14 September 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  `Presentation and source code here <https://github.com/strawlab/py4science-vbc/tree/master/2012-09-14>`_

  `Python + Gtk tutorial here <http://readthedocs.org/projects/python-gtk-3-tutorial/>`_

  `Comparison of plotting tools in Gtk <https://github.com/ap--/python-live-plotting>`_

  `Interfacing with C-code, bindings for free <https://github.com/nzjrs/gobject-modern-hello-world>`_

  We will look at using the GTK GUI toolkit from Python with special
  reference to two challenges faced when doing scientific programming:
  plotting and interfacing between Python and C. *We'll run examples
  that will work on a modern Ubuntu Linux install, and as the session
  will be hands-on, you are invited to follow along.*

**matplotlib: tips for getting from quick plots to publication-quality figures**

  Andrew Straw, IMP

  Friday, 24 August 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net>`_ is great for
  making plots of your data in a few lines of code. I'll share with
  you some tips I've developed over the years about how to efficiently
  go from those few lines into what is needed later in the publication
  cycle. This includes simplifying what is drawn, saving plots with
  mixed vector and raster data, and post-drawing composition and
  editing with `Inkscape <http://inkscape.org/>`_. The talk is based
  off `our lab styleguide <http://strawlab.org/styleguide/>`_.

**branches, merging and rebasing: more git (hands-on: bring your laptop)**

  Andrew Straw, IMP

  Friday, 13 July 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  .. raw:: html

    <a href="_static/git-tutorial-part2.html">Link to notes</a>

  As a followup to our first meeting on git, we're now going to move
  to the skills required to share your changes with a larger group of
  people working on the same software. This is a beginner-intermediate
  level talk. (If you're already a git guru, you will not likely learn
  much, but your attendance would be very welcomed by others in the
  room who will likely apppreciate your expertise.) *Bring your
  laptop with git pre-installed or with access to a server running
  git. At this hands-on py4science VBC, we will actively make changes
  to an online repository and submit them back.*

**Fiji, a user and developer friendly framework for image processing**

  Wolfgang Busch, Gregor Mendel Institute

  Friday, 22 June 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  It is a serious effort to provide experimentalists with usable open
  source software for computational analysis of their image data. A
  crossplatform package that combines the advantage of open source,
  high grade of usability and very broad application range, is
  Fiji. With Fiji, it is possible to provide packages to biologists
  that are very easy to install, as well as to maintain using Git
  version control features. I will demonstrate the usage of Fiji and
  the broad possibilities to create packages for it. http://fiji.sc/

**get control of your source code with git (hands-on: bring your laptop)**

  Andrew Straw, IMP

  Friday, 25 May 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  `presentation and source code here <https://github.com/strawlab/py4science-vbc/tree/master/2012-05-25>`_

  As scientists, it is critical to maintain accurate records of
  exactly what software we run when we perform a particular experiment
  or analysis. The standard way to do this is with revision control
  software which keeps track of what changed and when within a
  repository of files. In the past several years, a new class of such
  software has emerged, dramatically reducing the workload to set up a
  new source code repository, transfer version controlled files from
  one computer to another, and to collaborate with others. Git is
  amongst the best of these new solutions, and our lab is using git
  and an online service (github.com) to facilitate these actions to
  great effect. *Bring your laptop, because at this py4science VBC,
  we will walk you through installing git, cloning a repository from
  github, making changes to the repository, and pushing your changes
  back.*

**short introduction to opencv in python**

  Andreas Poehlmann, IMP

  Friday, 11 May 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming
  functions for real time computer vision. It has C++, C, Python and
  soon Java interfaces running on Windows, Linux, Android and Mac.
  The library has >2500 optimized algorithms. I'll give an introduction
  to the python opencv interface and show in a few examples how easy
  image processing can be nowadays.

**data persistence in python**

  Uemit Seren, Gregor Mendel Institute

  Friday, 27 April 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  Persisting data is typically done in a RDBMS (relational database
  management systems). However programmers work with domain models to
  represent the same data in their applications. ORM layers like
  SQLAlchemy help to overcome the impedance mismatch between these two
  systems and deal with implementation differences of the underlying
  data storage. Not every kind of data fits into a RDBMS however; bulk
  data/big data are not suitable for RDBMS and have to be stored in a
  different way (PyTables, HDF5,).  I will provide some examples for
  both storage systems and also try to show how to combine them.

**interfacing with native code from python**

  John Stowers, IMP

  Friday, 13 April 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  `presentation here <_static/py4science-vbc-2012-04-13.pdf>`_

  `source code here <https://github.com/strawlab/py4science-vbc/tree/master/2012-04-13>`_

  There are many ways to integrate with native code (i.e. C/C++ libraries)
  from python; ctypes, cython/pyrex, swig, native python modules, etc.
  Each method has different trade-offs in terms of performance, maintainability
  and extensibility. I will discus these trade-offs and give strategies for
  wrapping object orientated and performance critical native code.

**structured arrays in numpy**

  Andrew Straw, IMP

  Friday, 23 March 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  `presentation here <_static/py4science-vbc-2012-03-23.pdf>`_

  `source code here <https://github.com/strawlab/py4science-vbc/tree/master/2012-03-23>`_

  Numpy's structured arrays are a hybrid between a bare numpy array
  (just a bunch of numbers) and table in which each column has a name
  and particular data type. As a data container, they allow
  self-documenting massive amounts of data and are becoming
  increasingly used as an interchange format for reading and writing
  CSV files, HDF5 files, and performing R-like DataFrame analysis
  (with the Pandas library).
