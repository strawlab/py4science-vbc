<h1>Welcome to Py4Science at the Vienna Biocenter<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-py4science-at-the-vienna-biocenter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly growing in popularity.
It is easy to read, easy to write and it features a great selection of powerful libraries.</p>
<p>Py4Science VBC (Vienna Bio Center) is a monthly meeting series
facilitating cross-pollination between interested parties who use
Python as part of their scientific tool set. Those wishing to attend
do not need to be expert at python programming, but familiarity with
the language and some popular libraries such as numpy and matplotlib
is encouraged. Even if you are a complete beginner the talks will be
short (15 minutes) followed by interactive discussions and
demonstrations so you will not be bored.</p>

<p>Automated microscopy has become an enabling technology to monitor
and quantify properties of cells. A typical workflow to analyze
microscopy data comprises the segmentation of cells, linking of cell
objects over time, and quantification of cellular
phenotypes. CellCognition is published as open source software,
enabling automated analysis of live-cell image-based screening data.</p>

<p>Friday, 1 March 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)</p>
<p>Although C# does not have such a dedicated community for scientific
computing as Python, its modern language features allow for a high
level of code reuse and extend some of the features found in
Python. I will show some examples from Computer Graphics, which show
how the combination of generic and functional programming with a
strong type system can benefit the impementation of algorithms for
scientific computing.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Dr. Tobler is a senior research at VRVis Research Center
for Virtual Reality and Visualization in Vienna, Austria. His
professional interests include real-time and photorealistic
rendering, efficient global illumination algorithms, and
procedurally generated geometry and generalized subdivision. His web

<p><strong>A Bayesian t test using PyMC</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Andrew Straw, IMP</p>
<p>Friday, 1 February 2013, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)</p>
<p>Across many branches of biology, null hypothesis significance
testing is the tried-and-true method of establishing whether an
effect is &#8220;real&#8221;. Nevertheless, many pitfalls must be avoided to
correctly evaluate statistical significance and it is easy to make
mistakes that render the analysis invalid. I will summarize a recent
paper <em>Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test</em> (&#8220;BEST&#8221;) by John
Kruschke (2012, Journal of Experimental Psychology:
General.). Kruschke&#8217;s Bayesian approach purports to acheive the same
goals as the t test with fewer potential pitfalls. Furthermore, his
approach has several advantages, such as the ability to accept the
null hypothesis. Computationally, credible intervals of important
parameters such population means and effect size are found using
Monte-Carlo techniques such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. I
will discuss a <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/strawlab/best">Python implementation of the BEST algorithm</a> written using PyMC.</p>

<p>Profiling is an important but often neglected aspect in programming,
especially in the area of scientific computing. I will show various
tools that can be used to identify performance hotspots in your
code.  We will use timeit to measure the execution time, move on to
cProfile and pstats for detailed profiling. Based on the results of
cProfile I will show how to interpret the results visually and
finally demonstrate line_profiler.py for retrieving line by line
profiling information.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a> is great for
making plots of your data in a few lines of code. I&#8217;ll share with

cycle. This includes simplifying what is drawn, saving plots with
mixed vector and raster data, and post-drawing composition and

<p><strong>Fiji, a user and developer friendly framework for image processing</strong></p>

<p>It is a serious effort to provide experimentalists with usable open
source software for computational analysis of their image data. A
crossplatform package that combines the advantage of open source,
high grade of usability and very broad application range, is
Fiji. With Fiji, it is possible to provide packages to biologists
that are very easy to install, as well as to maintain using Git
version control features. I will demonstrate the usage of Fiji and
the broad possibilities to create packages for it. <a class="reference external" href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</a></p>

<p><strong>get control of your source code with git (hands-on: bring your laptop)</strong></p>

<p>As scientists, it is critical to maintain accurate records of
exactly what software we run when we perform a particular experiment
or analysis. The standard way to do this is with revision control
software which keeps track of what changed and when within a
repository of files. In the past several years, a new class of such
software has emerged, dramatically reducing the workload to set up a
new source code repository, transfer version controlled files from
one computer to another, and to collaborate with others. Git is
amongst the best of these new solutions, and our lab is using git
and an online service (github.com) to facilitate these actions to
great effect. <em>Bring your laptop, because at this py4science VBC,
we will walk you through installing git, cloning a repository from
github, making changes to the repository, and pushing your changes
back.</em></p>

<p>OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming
functions for real time computer vision. It has C++, C, Python and
soon Java interfaces running on Windows, Linux, Android and Mac.
The library has &gt;2500 optimized algorithms. I&#8217;ll give an introduction
to the python opencv interface and show in a few examples how easy
image processing can be nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>data persistence in python</strong></p>

<div><p>Uemit Seren, Gregor Mendel Institute</p>
<p>Friday, 27 April 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)</p>
<p>Persisting data is typically done in a RDBMS (relational database
management systems). However programmers work with domain models to
represent the same data in their applications. ORM layers like
SQLAlchemy help to overcome the impedance mismatch between these two
systems and deal with implementation differences of the underlying
data storage. Not every kind of data fits into a RDBMS however; bulk
data/big data are not suitable for RDBMS and have to be stored in a
different way (PyTables, HDF5,).  I will provide some examples for
both storage systems and also try to show how to combine them.</p>

<p><strong>interfacing with native code from python</strong></p>

<p>There are many ways to integrate with native code (i.e. C/C++ libraries)
from python; ctypes, cython/pyrex, swig, native python modules, etc.
Each method has different trade-offs in terms of performance, maintainability
and extensibility. I will discus these trade-offs and give strategies for
wrapping object orientated and performance critical native code.</p>

<p><strong>structured arrays in numpy</strong></p>

<p>Numpy&#8217;s structured arrays are a hybrid between a bare numpy array
(just a bunch of numbers) and table in which each column has a name
and particular data type. As a data container, they allow
self-documenting massive amounts of data and are becoming
increasingly used as an interchange format for reading and writing
CSV files, HDF5 files, and performing R-like DataFrame analysis
(with the Pandas library).</p>
